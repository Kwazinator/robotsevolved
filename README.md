<p>Created this project as a way to learn the React Web-framework, feel free to play a https://robotsevolved.com<br></p>

<br>How to play:
<br>There are 4 pieces (Robots) on a screen and they dont have breaks. They move like rumbas until they hit a wall or another piece.
<br>select a robot by clicking it. Then touch the direction where they should move. The goal is to get ONE of the pieces to the swirl (Goal).
<br>Robots use power when they move so they value the lowest number of moves to solve a puzzle.
<br>#################################################################
<br>For those who want to CREATE a board:
<br>Drag Robots or the goal to the location you want them to be at (you can also modify the width,height) of the board
<br>Click on Wall spots to toggle wall placements
<br>the game operates like Super Mario Maker. Toggle the Build Mode option and solve the puzzle.
<br>If you cannot solve the puzzle you cannot submit it to the "public"
